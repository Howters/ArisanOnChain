        },
        "q2": {
          "q": "How is the winner determined?",
          "a": "The admin triggers winner determination after all members have contributed. An on-chain random selection picks from eligible members (those who haven't won yet). The selection uses block data for randomness and is fully transparent."

        "q3": {
          "q": "When can I withdraw my security deposit?",
          "a": "Security deposits can only be withdrawn after the pool is completed (all rounds finished) or cancelled (before activation). Active members in completed pools get their full deposit back."
        },
        "q4": {
          "q": "What is social vouching?",
          "a": "Active members with good reputation (completed pools, zero defaults) can vouch for new joiners by locking their own funds. If the vouchee defaults, the voucher loses their stake. This creates social accountability and helps newcomers join pools."

        "q5": {
          "q": "Do I need cryptocurrency knowledge?",
          "a": "No! ArisanAman is designed for everyone. Just login with Google, and everything happens behind the scenes. No wallet setup, no gas fees to worry about. It feels like a regular app."
        },
        "q6": {
          "q": "What are the fees?",
          "a": "Creating pools: FREE. Joining pools: FREE. Monthly contributions: 0% fee. Withdrawals: FREE. The only fee is 1.5% on the winning payout when you claim your prize."
        },
        "q7": {
          "q": "What is a Debt NFT?",
          "a": "When someone defaults, they receive a non-transferable NFT that permanently records their default on the blockchain. This serves as an on-chain credit record that other pool admins can check before approving members."
        },
        "q8": {
          "q": "How many members do I need to start?",
          "a": "A minimum of 3 active members (who have locked their security deposit) is required to activate a pool. The maximum is set by the pool creator."
