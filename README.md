🏗️ Build Prompt: ArisanAman MVP (On-Chain ROSCA)I. Project Core & Technology StackComponentDetailRationaleProject NameArisanAman (Internal Working Title: TrustCircle)Emphasizes security and simplicity.BlockchainLisk L2/Sepolia (Testnet)Smart Contracts deployed on Sepolia (for EVM compatibility) aiming for Lisk's low-fee environment.Tech StackFrontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Components: Shadcn/UI (Minimalist, modern, clean aesthetic) + Radix UI (for primitives).Focus on a premium, non-crypto-native look to appeal to the target market (Ibu-ibu).Core InnovationAccount Abstraction (AA) for UX, Social Staking for anti-scam logic.The unique selling proposition that solves the "Wallet Barrier" and "Runaway Scammer" problem.II. Core Feature Flow & Smart Contract Logic (MVP)The MVP must be a single, functional, fixed-rotation Arisan with working staking/penalty logic.1. Account Abstraction & Onboarding (The Zero-Barrier UX)Login Flow: Replace all "Connect Wallet" buttons with "Login with Google/WhatsApp."Goal: Simulate AA. When a user logs in, the app internally creates and manages their Invisible Smart Contract Wallet.Gas Abstraction: All user-initiated transactions (Contribute, Claim Pot) must be Gasless for the user.MVP Implementation: Mock the Paymaster. The frontend sends the transaction and assumes the gas fee is paid by a subsidized account (the app's account).2. Pool Creation & Management (Reference Njangi 1, 6, 9)Create Pool: Admin sets: Contribution Amount (USDC Mock), Payment Frequency (Monthly), Max Members (3 minimum).Njangi Ref (1, 6): Fixed rotation only for MVP.Security Deposit (The Stake): Admin sets the Security Deposit amount (e.g., 1x the Contribution Amount). This is adjustable.Rotation Order Alert (Ref. Njangi 9): Implement an aggressive alert banner on the Manage page if the Admin has not set the mandatory rotation order for all confirmed members. The pool cannot be activated until this is fixed.3. Contribution & Staking (Reference Njangi 5, 13)Deposit Requirement: A user must pay their Security Deposit first before they can contribute their regular monthly contribution (Ref. Njangi 5, 13).Flow: User sees two balance categories in their Invisible Wallet: Locked Stake and Liquid Funds (USDC).Contribution Page: Contains a button "Contribute [Amount] (Simulated QRIS Payment)."Mock: Clicking this button simulates a fiat payment and triggers the Smart Contract to pull USDC/Stablecoin from the user's wallet into the Pool Contract.4. Innovation: Social Vouching & Penalty Logic (Anti-Scam)Vouching Status: When a new member joins, they appear in the Admin's pending list (Ref. Njangi 8).Vouch/Stake Button: On the Pending Join Request view, provide a button "Vouch/Guarantee Member" for existing members.Logic: Clicking this triggers a transaction that locks the Admin/Guarantor's own Security Deposit as secondary collateral for the new member.Penalty/Default Logic:Admin Action: Admin clicks "Report Member Default" if a payment is missed.Smart Contract Action (Core MVP Logic): If the Admin reports default, the contract immediately:Burns/Liquidates the member's initial Security Deposit.Mints a "DEBT DEFAULT NFT" to the member's wallet address.The recovered funds are used to compensate the pool or the next winner.5. Payout & Yield Simulation (Ref. Njangi 11)Winner Determination: Admin clicks "Determine Winner (Kocok Arisan)".Logic: Use a simple pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) function in the contract to select the next winner based on the rotation order.Auto-Swap/Yield (Ref. Njangi 11, 12):UI Feature: On the Pool Management page, display "Stablecoin Auto-Yield: Enabled".Simulation: Funds in the Pool Balance should display a mocked daily percentage increase (e.g., +0.01% daily) to simulate real-time DeFi yield on the locked USDC.Payout: The winner receives the Principal Pot + Accumulated Yield (mocked calculation).III. UI/UX & Page BreakdownThe design must be simple, focusing on tables and clear status indicators (Shadcn/UI components).1. Landing Page (Minimalist)Focus: Single Call-to-Action (CTA): "Start Your Safe Arisan (Login with Google/WA)."Value Props: Three simple, elegant cards summarizing: 1) Zero Scam Risk, 2) Free to Use (No Gas Fee), 3) Earn Yield on Savings.2. Dashboard (/dashboard)Content: Card-based list of "My Circles." (Status: Active, Pending, Completed).Wallet Balances (Visible): A clear widget showing: USDC Liquid Balance, Total Locked Stake, and Total Earned Yield. (Ref. Njangi 11).3. Pool Management Page (/circle/[id])Core Feature: A clear Status Banner (e.g., "Active: Month 3 of 10").Member Table (Ref. Njangi 8, 13): Shadcn Table showing:Member Name (Google Username)Wallet Address (Shortened: 0x...23bb)Deposit Status (Crucial): Paid / Missing Stake / Vouched.Action Column: Admin view only (Remove Member, View Profile).Pending Requests: A collapsible section with pending members and the "Approve/Reject" buttons.Admin Tools: Buttons for "Edit Rotation Order," "Determine Winner," and "Report Default."4. Member Profile Page (/profile/[address])Content: Displays the member's On-Chain Reputation/Credit Score:"Completed Circles:" X/Y"Default Count:" Z"Debt NFT Status:" (None / Active Default).IV. Key Implementation FocusLisk/Sepolia Integration: Ensure the Smart Contract deployment and interaction logic is set up correctly for the Lisk/Sepolia EVM environment.State Management: Use a clean state management library (Zustand or similar) to handle the global state of the user's Invisible Wallet and the Arisan pools.Code Quality: Prioritize clear, type-safe TypeScript and modular components (Shadcn/Radix).
